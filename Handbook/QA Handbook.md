## Task Estimation in Scrum
  
### Introduction  

### Estimation Techniques

- There are many different approaches and techniques to estimating tasks, such as:

	 - Planning Poker: Where team members estimate the effort of a task by playing a number card face down, then discussing all the estimates and coming to an agreement
	- T-Shirt Sizes: Uses sizes (XS, S, M, L, XL) to estimate the size complexity of tasks
	 - Fibonacci Story Points: Used to represent the effort required for completing a task using the Fibonacci number sequence 1,2,3,5,8,13.

- Despite the variety of techniques available, there are foundational best practices that all teams should adhere to, regardless of the specific estimation method employed.

	- Estimates should be made by the people carrying out the work not an above hierarchy.
	- Acknowledge human tendencies like optimism bias that can lead to underestimation.
	- Avoid using time-based estimates, as time is a definite measurement, and a definite measurement does not fit into the agile methodology. 
	- Continually refine and adjust estimates as the team velocity becomes more apparent.

### Challenges and Considerations for Task Estimation

- Although task estimation presents its challenges, it can be simplified and made more effective through deliberate considerations.

	- Challenges

		- Optimism and Individual Bias: Estimators may experience optimism or personal bias which can hinder accurate estimation.
		- Understanding Task Complexity: Misunderstanding the task or not knowing the full breadth of the task can lead to inaccurate task estimations.
		- Stakeholder / External pressure: Project constraints such as deadlines and budgets can influence the estimation process. Deadline pressures may lead to tasks being optimistically estimated and ultimately being inaccurately estimated.
		- Parkinson's Law / Changing requirements: Parkinson's Law is the observation of work expanding (new requirements) to fill the time available for its completion. This can lead to inaccurate task estimations as the original estimation did not consider the new requirements.

	- Considerations 

		- Use Previous Estimations: Utilise previous task estimations and the actual effort exerted on the task to provide a more accurate estimate, learning from previous experiences.
		- Experienced Developers: Use the experience and expertise of senior developers to best explain the task on hand and the technical requirements to complete the task.
		- Risk Management: Attempt to identify potential risks or unforeseen challenges that may be involved in a particular task. potentially add some buffer estimates to consider these risks.
