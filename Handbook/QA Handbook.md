## What Are Code Reviews?
 
 - A code review is the task of someone who is not the author reviewing a piece of code before it is merged to the main codebase 
 - A code review is an essential practice to ensure that the code is high quality, aligns with predetermined standards, contains no mistakes
 - Many companies practice different processes of how to carry out code reviews. Different processes depend on a number of factors such as, the level of experience of developers, specific project or regulatory requirements,and the complexity and lifecycle stage of the project, etc. Below are some different approaches:
    - Checklist-Based Reviews - where reviewers follow a predetermined list of checks to follow while reviewing code.
    - Pair Programming - where a developer codes and gets real-time feedback (code review) on their code.
    - Pre-Commit Reviews - This is where code is reviewed before it is merged into the main branch.
- Google mandates code reviews and and follows the Pre-commit review. Below is a diagram of their Code Review Flow.

## Best Practices for Conducting Effective Code Reviews

- Although there are many different approaches to conducting a code review, there are some key practices that should be considered for the code review to be effective. 
- As well as key practices, included in this section are some practices that we feel are beneficial to fostering a positive and effective feedback 

- For Reviewers
    - The reviewer should be experienced enough, so that they know what they are looking for such as design, logic, and bugs
    - Adhere to a predefined checklist that define the goals and standards of the review process
    - Code reviews should not be rushed to avoid code smells entering the main codebase. Limiting code review sessions or setting a maximum line of code (LOC) per hour can ensure that the reviewer does not lose focus
    - Feedback should be constructive. Providing constructive feedback helps to enhance understanding and learning rather then incite competition or conflict.
- For Reviewees
    - Reviewee must be receptive to feedback. They must have a willingness to learn and understand criticism is not personal.
    - Code must be reviewed by the reviewee before requesting a code review, to save the reviewers from having to respond to miscellaneous errors such as spelling mistakes.
    - Seek and give clarity when needed. Be prepared to offer clarity on code you have produced and seek clarity when feedback is unclear.
    - Small, incremental code changes should be the aim as code with many lines is more straneous to review.
