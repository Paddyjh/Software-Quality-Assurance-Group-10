# Quality Assurance Handbook

## Introduction

## Task Estimation in Scrum£º
Introduce:
What is Task Estimation and why it is one of the key features?
	In the initial stage of software development, the demand side usually has clear requirements and not very clear expectations for the final software product, and software quality refers to the degree of conformity with the final product. Specifically, software quality refers to the degree to which software conforms to clearly stated functional and performance requirements, development criteria, and stealth characteristics that any professionally developed software should possess.

Use an example to show these three aspects: 
* Deadline (Checkpoint),
* Person in charge 
* Risk Control

??Assume a Scrum project with a release cycle of 2 weeks, 1 project manager, 1 requirement, 2 front-end, 2 back-end, and 2 testers. Requirements personnel provide requirements list, organize project personnel requirements review, and determine the coverage of version requirements.
Developers and testers evaluate the workload according to the requirements and determine the workload of each subtask by average. The project manager makes a schedule, specifying the workload of each subtask, the start time, the end time, and the person in charge.
??The project manager team hosts the daily meeting of the project team, the meeting time is limited to 10 minutes, and members in the team report the current task progress and problems encountered. The project manager checks the schedule to determine if the project progress is consistent with the schedule. Solve the problems existing in the project team, summarize the current risks of the project and give solutions in time, report the high-risk items to the senior management of the company, and communicate with Party A in time. If the project manpower or technology is lacking, timely communication and supplement; For example, the project requirements affect the system function, the workload is far beyond the estimated work, and timely communication for project changes.
??The project manager organizes the developer code review to ensure that the code is normative and provides more possibilities for subsequent iterations. In the process of project development, developers require self-testing, testers implement access mechanisms, and the main process blocks the version back to developers to improve testing efficiency. The test phase is full test, the production environment is tested, the version update has a backup mechanism, and the quality of the released version is strictly controlled. The project carried out a phased summary meeting, analyzed the task delay rate of developers, bug productivity, etc., analyzed the leakage testing behavior of testers and the stability of version launch, and analyzed the rationality of the range of requirements for iterative versions.
