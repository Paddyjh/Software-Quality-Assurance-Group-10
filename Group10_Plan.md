Group 10 Plan for Group Assignment 

Firstly, we had a meeting to discuss the project and also to assign a member to the different topics, each member chose two topics each. We then discussed on decided on the following plan which we will follow to maximise our collaboration and learning from this assignment.
We also craeted a test git repostiry to ensure that our rules requiring 2 user approvals were working correctly for pull request and merging

Plan
-	Each member of the group will revise the lecture on git-flow and further research the topic to ensure all members fully understand the git-flow process.
-   The team will create a develop branch from the main branch
-	The team will create a feature branch from the develop branch for each topic.
-	Team members will divide the discussion about each topic into smaller sections, which can be divided among the two team members working on the given topic. Creating smaller sections will allow for easier collaboration and reduce conflicts when merging. 
-	Team members will research their given topic and write a first draft, in which they will create a pull request.
-	The two other team members will evaluate the given draft, give constructive feedback, and suggest changes to be made via comments on the pull request.
-	The group member will ensure to address all comments on their pull request and can re-request review, in which case the same process of making comments and suggestions may happen until all parties are satisfied with the content. 
-	Content can be merged once the other two members approve the pull request
-	Once all sections have been successfully merged into the feature branch, this branch can then be merged into the develop branch 
-	Once all features (topics) have been successfully merged into develop branch then this branch can be merged into master.

Time frames 
-	We have set a deadline of 24 hours for code reviews to take place. This means that both developers not working on a particular section should have reviewed the submitted pull request within 24 hours of it being uploaded to git
-	We have set a deadline for first drafts for the 
-	We have set the deadline for final draft as the 16th of March at 12pm. This means we must have all features fully developed and merged into the main branch by the 16th of march
-	Each team member is fully aware of these deadlines and has committed to follow them. 

Approval Criteria
-   Work must be free of spelling mistakes and grammatical errors
-   Work must conatin referneces 
-   Work must be of a high quality and easy to follow, the goal is for a new team member with minimal knowledege to be able to understand this document
-   2 individuals exlusing the orignial author must approve all work before merging into a branch 
-   Work must be styled nicely, using correct formating and other desing elements where possible
