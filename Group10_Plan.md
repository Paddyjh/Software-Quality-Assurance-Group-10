# Group 10
# Plan for Group Assignment

Firstly, we had a meeting to discuss the project and also to assign a member to the different topics, each member chose two topics each. We then discussed on decided on the following plan which we will follow to maximise our collaboration and learning from this assignment.
We also created a test git repository to ensure that our rules requiring two user approvals were working correctly for pull requests and merging

## Plan
-   Each member of the group will revise the lecture on git-flow and further research the topic to ensure all members fully understand the git-flow process.
-   The team will create a develop branch from the main branch
-   The team will create a feature branch from the develop branch for each topic.
-   Team members will divide the discussion about each topic into smaller sections, which can be divided among the two team members working on the given topic. Creating smaller sections will allow for easier collaboration and reduce conflicts when merging.
-   Team members will research their given topic and write a first draft, in which they will create a pull request.
-   The two other team members will evaluate the given draft, give constructive feedback, and suggest changes to be made via comments on the pull request.
-   The group member will ensure to address all comments on their pull request and can re-request review, in which case the same process of making comments and suggestions may happen until all parties are satisfied with the content.
-   Content can be merged once the other two members approve the pull request.
-   Once all sections have been successfully merged into the feature branch, this branch can then be merged into the develop branch.
-   Once all features (topics) have been successfully merged into develop branch then this branch can be merged into master.

## Time frames
-   We have set a deadline of two days for code reviews to take place. This means that both developers not working on a particular section should have reviewed the submitted pull request within 24 hours of it being uploaded to git.
-   We have set a deadline for the first drafts of each topic on the 21st of March. 
-   We have set the deadline for the final draft as the 24th of March at 12 pm. This means we must have all features fully developed and merged into the main branch by the 24th of March
Each team member is fully aware of these deadlines and has committed to follow them.

## Approval Criteria
-   Work must be free of spelling mistakes and grammatical errors.
-   Work must contain references
-   Work must be of a high quality and easy to follow. The goal is for a new team member with minimal knowledge to be able to understand this document.
-   Two individuals, excluding the original author, must approve all work before merging into a branch. **(Our git ruleset enforces this)**
-   All pull request comments must be resolved before merging. **(Our git ruleset enforces this)**
-   Work must be styled nicely, using correct formatting and other design elements where possible.

## Naming conventions
-   Feature branches must be named in the following format: "feature/Name-Of-Feature"
-   All commits must be named in the following format: "Name-Of-Feature-description-of-commit" **(Only the Feature name is capitalised)**
-   Bug fix branches must be named in the following format: "bugfix/description-of-bugfix"

## Team Retrospective

| What went well? | What didn't go well? | What can we do differently next time? |
|-----------------|-----------------------|---------------------------------------|
| Team collaboration on pull request                | Some deadlines were adjusted as project developed                      |  Set more realistic deadlines, taking other assignments deadlines and team member schedules into consideration                                    | 
| Active communication throughout the project, via WhatsApp and Teams               | Did not have set meeting times due to timetable conflicts                       |  Try to establish a regular meeting time                                     |
| Team members facilitated knowledge sharing with less experienced colleagues e.g Git process & commands               |                       | We would try to respond quicker to comments left in pull requests    | 
| The team enhanced their understanding of git and the git-flow process | | We would try to be more descriptive in certain comments to avoid ambiguity
| The team gained valuable insights on all topics researched | | We would set up a jira board to break down tasks and track the project as it developed
